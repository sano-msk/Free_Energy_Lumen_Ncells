This matlab file is to calculate Free Energy for Lumen and N Cells (Cyst, Organoids)
Calculation is based on the symmetric configuraltion of N=2,4,8,12 cells
in 3D with the asumption of apical and lateral surface tension of cells, 
elasiticity of cell volume, and elasticity of ECM under the lumen
pressure \Delta p (see Lu et al. in Nature Comm.(2025) for details.)
